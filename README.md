# About
ShapeKey Sync lets you set the same named shape key to multiple objects.
you can find it on the data tab and move it around to your liking!

you can also find this addon on gumroad https://raska.gumroad.com/l/ShapeKeySync

# How to use

- select the main object 
- select the shape key you want to change and it will do it for all of them.

here is a quick video demonstrating it working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8gw-KJSFS8


### Additional settings

**The collection field**  let you select a collection (duh) to which the addon needs to be confined, if no collection is selected then it will automatically use the scene collection.



**The AllObject toggle** is useful if you want to set (or not) that shapekeys for all the sub-collections, so if toggled on, all your object (no matter how many sub-collections you have) will inherit that transformation. Otherwise only the object directy inside will inherit the transformation.

- Don't worry about having objects that don't have the same shape keys, it will not mess with them, it will only act if it will find the correct name.
